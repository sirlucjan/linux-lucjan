+                         BitMap queue CPU Scheduler
+                         --------------------------

+
+
+Background
+==========
+
+BitMap Queue CPU scheduler, referred to as BMQ from here on, is an evolution
+of previous Priority and Deadline based Skiplist multiple queue scheduler(PDS),
+and inspired by Zircon scheduler. The goal of it is to keep the scheduler code
+simple, while efficiency and scalable for interactive tasks, such as desktop,
+movie playback and gaming etc.
+
+Design
+======
+
+Overview
+--------
+
+BMQ use per CPU run queue design, each CPU(logical) has it's own run queue,
+each CPU is responsible for scheduling the tasks that are putting into it's
+run queue.
+
+The run queue is a set of priority queues. Note that these queues are fifo
+queue for non-rt tasks or priority queue for rt tasks in data structure. See
+BitMap Queue below for details. BMQ is optimized for non-rt tasks in the fact
+that most applications are non-rt tasks. No matter the queue is fifo or
+priority, In each queue is an ordered list of runnable tasks awaiting execution
+and the data structures are the same. When it is time for a new task to run,
+the scheduler simply looks the lowest numbered queueue that contains a task,
+and runs the first task from the head of that queue. And per CPU idle task is
+also in the run queue, so the scheduler can always find a task to run on from
+its run queue.
+
+Each task will assigned the same timeslice(default 4ms) when it is picked to
+start running. Task will be reinserted at the end of the appropriate priority
+queue when it uses its whole timeslice. When the scheduler selects a new task
+from the priority queue it sets the CPU's preemption timer for the remainder of
+the previous timeslice. When that timer fires the scheduler will stop execution
+on that task, select another task and start over again.
+
+If a task blocks waiting for a shared resource then it's taken out of its
+priority queue and is placed in a wait queue for the shared resource. When it
+is unblocked it will be reinserted in the appropriate priority queue of an
+eligible CPU.
+
+Task policy
+-----------
+
+BMQ supports DEADLINE, FIFO, RR, NORMAL, BATCH and IDLE task policy like the
+mainline CFS scheduler. But BMQ is heavy optimized for non-rt task, that's
+NORMAL/BATCH/IDLE policy tasks. Below is the implementation detail of each
+policy.
+
+DEADLINE
+	It is squashed as priority 0 FIFO task.
+
+FIFO/RR
+	All RT tasks share one single priority queue in BMQ run queue designed. The
+complexity of insert operation is O(n). BMQ is not designed for system runs
+with major rt policy tasks.
+
+NORMAL/BATCH/IDLE
+	BATCH and IDLE tasks are treated as the same policy. They compete CPU with
+NORMAL policy tasks, but they just don't boost. To control the priority of
+NORMAL/BATCH/IDLE tasks, simply use nice level.
+
+ISO
+	ISO policy is not supported in BMQ. Please use nice level -20 NORMAL policy
+task instead.
+
+Priority management
+-------------------
+
+RT tasks have priority from 0-99. For non-rt tasks, there are three different
+factors used to determine the effective priority of a task. The effective
+priority being what is used to determine which queue it will be in.
+
+The first factor is simply the task’s static priority. Which is assigned from
+task's nice level, within [-20, 19] in userland's point of view and [0, 39]
+internally.

+The Ultra Kernel Samepage Merging feature
+----------------------------------------------
+/*
+ * Ultra KSM. Copyright (C) 2011-2012 Nai Xia
+ *
+ * This is an improvement upon KSM. Some basic data structures and routines
+ * are borrowed from ksm.c .
+ *
+ * Its new features:
+ * 1. Full system scan:
+ *      It automatically scans all user processes' anonymous VMAs. Kernel-user
+ *      interaction to submit a memory area to KSM is no longer needed.
+ *
+ * 2. Rich area detection:
+ *      It automatically detects rich areas containing abundant duplicated
+ *      pages based. Rich areas are given a full scan speed. Poor areas are
+ *      sampled at a reasonable speed with very low CPU consumption.
+ *
+ * 3. Ultra Per-page scan speed improvement:
+ *      A new hash algorithm is proposed. As a result, on a machine with
+ *      Core(TM)2 Quad Q9300 CPU in 32-bit mode and 800MHZ DDR2 main memory, it
+ *      can scan memory areas that does not contain duplicated pages at speed of
+ *      627MB/sec ~ 2445MB/sec and can merge duplicated areas at speed of
+ *      477MB/sec ~ 923MB/sec.
+ *
+ * 4. Thrashing area avoidance:
+ *      Thrashing area(an VMA that has frequent Ksm page break-out) can be
+ *      filtered out. My benchmark shows it's more efficient than KSM's per-page
+ *      hash value based volatile page detection.
+ *
+ *
+ * 5. Misc changes upon KSM:
+ *      * It has a fully x86-opitmized memcmp dedicated for 4-byte-aligned page
+ *        comparison. It's much faster than default C version on x86.
+ *      * rmap_item now has an struct *page member to loosely cache a
+ *        address-->page mapping, which reduces too much time-costly
+ *        follow_page().
+ *      * The VMA creation/exit procedures are hooked to let the Ultra KSM know.
+ *      * try_to_merge_two_pages() now can revert a pte if it fails. No break_
+ *        ksm is needed for this case.
+ *
+ * 6. Full Zero Page consideration(contributed by Figo Zhang)
+ *    Now uksmd consider full zero pages as special pages and merge them to an
+ *    special unswappable uksm zero page.

-	 * of the drive. In such a situation, the drive, by deciding
-	 * the service order of the internally-queued requests, does
-	 * determine also the actual throughput distribution among
-	 * these processes. But the drive typically has no notion or
-	 * concern about per-process throughput distribution, and
-	 * makes its decisions only on a per-request basis. Therefore,
-	 * the service distribution enforced by the drive's internal
-	 * scheduler is likely to coincide with the desired
-	 * device-throughput distribution only in a completely
-	 * symmetric scenario where:
-	 * (i)  each of these processes must get the same throughput as
-	 *      the others;
-	 * (ii) the I/O of each process has the same properties, in
-	 *      terms of locality (sequential or random), direction
-	 *      (reads or writes), request sizes, greediness
-	 *      (from I/O-bound to sporadic), and so on.
-	 * In fact, in such a scenario, the drive tends to treat
-	 * the requests of each of these processes in about the same
-	 * way as the requests of the others, and thus to provide
-	 * each of these processes with about the same throughput
-	 * (which is exactly the desired throughput distribution). In
-	 * contrast, in any asymmetric scenario, device idling is
-	 * certainly needed to guarantee that bfqq receives its
-	 * assigned fraction of the device throughput (see [1] for
-	 * details).
-	 * The problem is that idling may significantly reduce
-	 * throughput with certain combinations of types of I/O and
-	 * devices. An important example is sync random I/O, on flash
-	 * storage with command queueing. So, unless bfqq falls in the
-	 * above cases where idling also boosts throughput, it would
-	 * be important to check conditions (i) and (ii) accurately,
-	 * so as to avoid idling when not strictly needed for service
-	 * guarantees.
-	 *
-	 * Unfortunately, it is extremely difficult to thoroughly
-	 * check condition (ii). And, in case there are active groups,
-	 * it becomes very difficult to check condition (i) too. In
-	 * fact, if there are active groups, then, for condition (i)
-	 * to become false, it is enough that an active group contains
-	 * more active processes or sub-groups than some other active
-	 * group. More precisely, for condition (i) to hold because of
-	 * such a group, it is not even necessary that the group is
-	 * (still) active: it is sufficient that, even if the group
-	 * has become inactive, some of its descendant processes still
-	 * have some request already dispatched but still waiting for
-	 * completion. In fact, requests have still to be guaranteed
-	 * their share of the throughput even after being
-	 * dispatched. In this respect, it is easy to show that, if a
-	 * group frequently becomes inactive while still having
-	 * in-flight requests, and if, when this happens, the group is
-	 * not considered in the calculation of whether the scenario
-	 * is asymmetric, then the group may fail to be guaranteed its
-	 * fair share of the throughput (basically because idling may
-	 * not be performed for the descendant processes of the group,
-	 * but it had to be).  We address this issue with the
-	 * following bi-modal behavior, implemented in the function
-	 * bfq_symmetric_scenario().
-	 *
-	 * If there are groups with requests waiting for completion
-	 * (as commented above, some of these groups may even be
-	 * already inactive), then the scenario is tagged as
-	 * asymmetric, conservatively, without checking any of the
-	 * conditions (i) and (ii). So the device is idled for bfqq.
-	 * This behavior matches also the fact that groups are created
-	 * exactly if controlling I/O is a primary concern (to
-	 * preserve bandwidth and latency guarantees).
-	 *
-	 * On the opposite end, if there are no groups with requests
-	 * waiting for completion, then only condition (i) is actually
-	 * controlled, i.e., provided that condition (i) holds, idling
-	 * is not performed, regardless of whether condition (ii)
-	 * holds. In other words, only if condition (i) does not hold,
-	 * then idling is allowed, and the device tends to be
-	 * prevented from queueing many requests, possibly of several
-	 * processes. Since there are no groups with requests waiting
-	 * for completion, then, to control condition (i) it is enough
-	 * to check just whether all the queues with requests waiting
-	 * for completion also have the same weight.
-	 *
-	 * Not checking condition (ii) evidently exposes bfqq to the
-	 * risk of getting less throughput than its fair share.
-	 * However, for queues with the same weight, a further
-	 * mechanism, preemption, mitigates or even eliminates this
-	 * problem. And it does so without consequences on overall
-	 * throughput. This mechanism and its benefits are explained
-	 * in the next three paragraphs.
-	 *
-	 * Even if a queue, say Q, is expired when it remains idle, Q
-	 * can still preempt the new in-service queue if the next
-	 * request of Q arrives soon (see the comments on
-	 * bfq_bfqq_update_budg_for_activation). If all queues and
-	 * groups have the same weight, this form of preemption,
-	 * combined with the hole-recovery heuristic described in the
-	 * comments on function bfq_bfqq_update_budg_for_activation,
-	 * are enough to preserve a correct bandwidth distribution in
-	 * the mid term, even without idling. In fact, even if not
-	 * idling allows the internal queues of the device to contain
-	 * many requests, and thus to reorder requests, we can rather
-	 * safely assume that the internal scheduler still preserves a
-	 * minimum of mid-term fairness.
-	 *
-	 * More precisely, this preemption-based, idleless approach
-	 * provides fairness in terms of IOPS, and not sectors per
-	 * second. This can be seen with a simple example. Suppose
-	 * that there are two queues with the same weight, but that
-	 * the first queue receives requests of 8 sectors, while the
-	 * second queue receives requests of 1024 sectors. In
-	 * addition, suppose that each of the two queues contains at
-	 * most one request at a time, which implies that each queue
-	 * always remains idle after it is served. Finally, after
-	 * remaining idle, each queue receives very quickly a new
-	 * request. It follows that the two queues are served
-	 * alternatively, preempting each other if needed. This
-	 * implies that, although both queues have the same weight,
-	 * the queue with large requests receives a service that is
-	 * 1024/8 times as high as the service received by the other
-	 * queue.
-	 *
-	 * The motivation for using preemption instead of idling (for
-	 * queues with the same weight) is that, by not idling,
-	 * service guarantees are preserved (completely or at least in
-	 * part) without minimally sacrificing throughput. And, if
-	 * there is no active group, then the primary expectation for
-	 * this device is probably a high throughput.
-	 *
-	 * We are now left only with explaining the additional
-	 * compound condition that is checked below for deciding
-	 * whether the scenario is asymmetric. To explain this
-	 * compound condition, we need to add that the function
-	 * bfq_symmetric_scenario checks the weights of only
-	 * non-weight-raised queues, for efficiency reasons (see
-	 * comments on bfq_weights_tree_add()). Then the fact that
-	 * bfqq is weight-raised is checked explicitly here. More
-	 * precisely, the compound condition below takes into account
-	 * also the fact that, even if bfqq is being weight-raised,
-	 * the scenario is still symmetric if all queues with requests
-	 * waiting for completion happen to be
-	 * weight-raised. Actually, we should be even more precise
-	 * here, and differentiate between interactive weight raising
-	 * and soft real-time weight raising.
-	 *
-	 * As a side note, it is worth considering that the above
-	 * device-idling countermeasures may however fail in the
-	 * following unlucky scenario: if idling is (correctly)
-	 * disabled in a time period during which all symmetry
-	 * sub-conditions hold, and hence the device is allowed to
-	 * enqueue many requests, but at some later point in time some

+ * The processes associated with bfqq may happen to generate their
+ * cumulative I/O at a lower rate than the rate at which the device
+ * could serve the same I/O. This is rather probable, e.g., if only
+ * one process is associated with bfqq and the device is an SSD. It
+ * results in bfqq becoming often empty while in service. In this
+ * respect, if BFQ is allowed to switch to another queue when bfqq
+ * remains empty, then the device goes on being fed with I/O requests,
+ * and the throughput is not affected. In contrast, if BFQ is not
+ * allowed to switch to another queue---because bfqq is sync and
+ * I/O-dispatch needs to be plugged while bfqq is temporarily
+ * empty---then, during the service of bfqq, there will be frequent
+ * "service holes", i.e., time intervals during which bfqq gets empty
+ * and the device can only consume the I/O already queued in its
+ * hardware queues. During service holes, the device may even get to
+ * remaining idle. In the end, during the service of bfqq, the device
+ * is driven at a lower speed than the one it can reach with the kind
+ * of I/O flowing through bfqq.
+ *
+ * To counter this loss of throughput, BFQ implements a "request
+ * injection mechanism", which tries to fill the above service holes
+ * with I/O requests taken from other queues. The hard part in this
+ * mechanism is finding the right amount of I/O to inject, so as to
+ * both boost throughput and not break bfqq's bandwidth and latency
+ * guarantees. In this respect, the mechanism maintains a per-queue
+ * inject limit, computed as below. While bfqq is empty, the injection
+ * mechanism dispatches extra I/O requests only until the total number
+ * of I/O requests in flight---i.e., already dispatched but not yet
+ * completed---remains lower than this limit.
+ *
+ * A first definition comes in handy to introduce the algorithm by
+ * which the inject limit is computed.  We define as first request for
+ * bfqq, an I/O request for bfqq that arrives while bfqq is in
+ * service, and causes bfqq to switch from empty to non-empty. The
+ * algorithm updates the limit as a function of the effect of
+ * injection on the service times of only the first requests of
+ * bfqq. The reason for this restriction is that these are the
+ * requests whose service time is affected most, because they are the
+ * first to arrive after injection possibly occurred.
+ *
+ * To evaluate the effect of injection, the algorithm measures the
+ * "total service time" of first requests. We define as total service
+ * time of an I/O request, the time that elapses since when the
+ * request is enqueued into bfqq, to when it is completed. This
+ * quantity allows the whole effect of injection to be measured. It is
+ * easy to see why. Suppose that some requests of other queues are
+ * actually injected while bfqq is empty, and that a new request R
+ * then arrives for bfqq. If the device does start to serve all or
+ * part of the injected requests during the service hole, then,
+ * because of this extra service, it may delay the next invocation of
+ * the dispatch hook of BFQ. Then, even after R gets eventually
+ * dispatched, the device may delay the actual service of R if it is
+ * still busy serving the extra requests, or if it decides to serve,
+ * before R, some extra request still present in its queues. As a
+ * conclusion, the cumulative extra delay caused by injection can be
+ * easily evaluated by just comparing the total service time of first
+ * requests with and without injection.
+ *
+ * The limit-update algorithm works as follows. On the arrival of a
+ * first request of bfqq, the algorithm measures the total time of the
+ * request only if one of the three cases below holds, and, for each
+ * case, it updates the limit as described below:
+ *
+ * (1) If there is no in-flight request. This gives a baseline for the
+ *     total service time of the requests of bfqq. If the baseline has
+ *     not been computed yet, then, after computing it, the limit is
+ *     set to 1, to start boosting throughput, and to prepare the
+ *     ground for the next case. If the baseline has already been
+ *     computed, then it is updated, in case it results to be lower
+ *     than the previous value.
+ *
+ * (2) If the limit is higher than 0 and there are in-flight
+ *     requests. By comparing the total service time in this case with
+ *     the above baseline, it is possible to know at which extent the
+ *     current value of the limit is inflating the total service
+ *     time. If the inflation is below a certain threshold, then bfqq
+ *     is assumed to be suffering from no perceivable loss of its
+ *     service guarantees, and the limit is even tentatively
+ *     increased. If the inflation is above the threshold, then the
+ *     limit is decreased. Due to the lack of any hysteresis, this
+ *     logic makes the limit oscillate even in steady workload
+ *     conditions. Yet we opted for it, because it is fast in reaching
+ *     the best value for the limit, as a function of the current I/O
+ *     workload. To reduce oscillations, this step is disabled for a
+ *     short time interval after the limit happens to be decreased.
+ *
+ * (3) Periodically, after resetting the limit, to make sure that the
+ *     limit eventually drops in case the workload changes. This is
+ *     needed because, after the limit has gone safely up for a
+ *     certain workload, it is impossible to guess whether the
+ *     baseline total service time may have changed, without measuring
+ *     it again without injection. A more effective version of this
+ *     step might be to just sample the baseline, by interrupting
+ *     injection only once, and then to reset/lower the limit only if
+ *     the total service time with the current limit does happen to be
+ *     too large.
+ *
+ * More details on each step are provided in the comments on the
+ * pieces of code that implement these steps: the branch handling the
+ * transition from empty to non empty in bfq_add_request(), the branch
+ * handling injection in bfq_select_queue(), and the function
+ * bfq_choose_bfqq_for_injection(). These comments also explain some
+ * exceptions, made by the injection mechanism in some special cases.

+ * Notes on Program-Order guarantees on SMP systems.
+ *
+ *  MIGRATION
+ *
+ * The basic program-order guarantee on SMP systems is that when a task [t]
+ * migrates, all its activity on its old CPU [c0] happens-before any subsequent
+ * execution on its new CPU [c1].
+ *
+ * For migration (of runnable tasks) this is provided by the following means:
+ *
+ *  A) UNLOCK of the rq(c0)->lock scheduling out task t
+ *  B) migration for t is required to synchronize *both* rq(c0)->lock and
+ *     rq(c1)->lock (if not at the same time, then in that order).
+ *  C) LOCK of the rq(c1)->lock scheduling in task
+ *
+ * Transitivity guarantees that B happens after A and C after B.
+ * Note: we only require RCpc transitivity.
+ * Note: the CPU doing B need not be c0 or c1
+ *
+ * Example:
+ *
+ *   CPU0            CPU1            CPU2
+ *
+ *   LOCK rq(0)->lock
+ *   sched-out X
+ *   sched-in Y
+ *   UNLOCK rq(0)->lock
+ *
+ *                                   LOCK rq(0)->lock // orders against CPU0
+ *                                   dequeue X
+ *                                   UNLOCK rq(0)->lock
+ *
+ *                                   LOCK rq(1)->lock
+ *                                   enqueue X
+ *                                   UNLOCK rq(1)->lock
+ *
+ *                   LOCK rq(1)->lock // orders against CPU2
+ *                   sched-out Z
+ *                   sched-in X
+ *                   UNLOCK rq(1)->lock
+ *
+ *
+ *  BLOCKING -- aka. SLEEP + WAKEUP
+ *
+ * For blocking we (obviously) need to provide the same guarantee as for
+ * migration. However the means are completely different as there is no lock
+ * chain to provide order. Instead we do:
+ *
+ *   1) smp_store_release(X->on_cpu, 0)
+ *   2) smp_cond_load_acquire(!X->on_cpu)
+ *
+ * Example:
+ *
+ *   CPU0 (schedule)  CPU1 (try_to_wake_up) CPU2 (schedule)
+ *
+ *   LOCK rq(0)->lock LOCK X->pi_lock
+ *   dequeue X
+ *   sched-out X
+ *   smp_store_release(X->on_cpu, 0);
+ *
+ *                    smp_cond_load_acquire(&X->on_cpu, !VAL);
+ *                    X->state = WAKING
+ *                    set_task_cpu(X,2)
+ *
+ *                    LOCK rq(2)->lock
+ *                    enqueue X
+ *                    X->state = RUNNING
+ *                    UNLOCK rq(2)->lock
+ *

+ *
+ * Imagine for instance the case where two tasks block on one CPU, only the one
+ * CPU will have IO-wait accounted, while the other has regular idle. Even
+ * though, if the storage were faster, both could've ran at the same time,
+ * utilising both CPUs.
+ *
+ * This means, that when looking globally, the current IO-wait accounting on
+ * SMP is a lower bound, by reason of under accounting.
+ *
+ * Worse, since the numbers are provided per CPU, they are sometimes

+ *
+ *   2. TIF_NEED_RESCHED flag is checked on interrupt and userspace return
+ *      paths. For example, see arch/x86/entry_64.S.
+ *
+ *      To drive preemption between tasks, the scheduler sets the flag in timer

+ *
+ *   3. Wakeups don't really cause entry into schedule(). They add a
+ *      task to the run-queue and that's it.
+ *
+ *      Now, if the new task added to the run-queue preempts the current
+ *      task, then the wakeup sets TIF_NEED_RESCHED and schedule() gets

+ * Ultra KSM. Copyright (C) 2011-2012 Nai Xia
+ *
+ * This is an improvement upon KSM. Some basic data structures and routines
+ * are borrowed from ksm.c .
+ *
+ * Its new features:
+ * 1. Full system scan:
+ *      It automatically scans all user processes' anonymous VMAs. Kernel-user
+ *      interaction to submit a memory area to KSM is no longer needed.
+ *
+ * 2. Rich area detection:
+ *      It automatically detects rich areas containing abundant duplicated
+ *      pages based. Rich areas are given a full scan speed. Poor areas are
+ *      sampled at a reasonable speed with very low CPU consumption.
+ *
+ * 3. Ultra Per-page scan speed improvement:
+ *      A new hash algorithm is proposed. As a result, on a machine with
+ *      Core(TM)2 Quad Q9300 CPU in 32-bit mode and 800MHZ DDR2 main memory, it
+ *      can scan memory areas that does not contain duplicated pages at speed of
+ *      627MB/sec ~ 2445MB/sec and can merge duplicated areas at speed of
+ *      477MB/sec ~ 923MB/sec.
+ *
+ * 4. Thrashing area avoidance:
+ *      Thrashing area(an VMA that has frequent Ksm page break-out) can be
+ *      filtered out. My benchmark shows it's more efficient than KSM's per-page
+ *      hash value based volatile page detection.
+ *
+ *
+ * 5. Misc changes upon KSM:
+ *      * It has a fully x86-opitmized memcmp dedicated for 4-byte-aligned page
+ *        comparison. It's much faster than default C version on x86.
+ *      * rmap_item now has an struct *page member to loosely cache a
+ *        address-->page mapping, which reduces too much time-costly
+ *        follow_page().
+ *      * The VMA creation/exit procedures are hooked to let the Ultra KSM know.
+ *      * try_to_merge_two_pages() now can revert a pte if it fails. No break_
+ *        ksm is needed for this case.
+ *
+ * 6. Full Zero Page consideration(contributed by Figo Zhang)
+ *    Now uksmd consider full zero pages as special pages and merge them to an
+ *    special unswappable uksm zero page.
